TO DO:
  4. Implement the MarketSimulator
  5. Implement the Order resource, to create/cancel orders
  6. Detect a big step into the buy book orders in comparison to the sell orders, and if that step is going to be resolved
     in a short period of time, then place a buy order for a price +0.01 EUR ahead of the big step. Then once it is matched, 
     immediately after place a sell order for a price +0.30% (this needs to be tested).
  
DONE:
  1. refactor in order to place all the resources into a api.resource package (including the beans into each folder)
  2. refactor to make all the *Resource classes to inherit from a Resource (that will centralize the logging initialization)

NOT TO DO:
  3. convert the SignableResource into a Signer initialized only once, and passed to every Resource needing it.
  Some methods involved are not thread safe.
