TO DO:
  4. Implement the MarketSimulator
  
DONE:
  1. refactor in order to place all the resources into a api.resource package (including the beans into each folder)
  2. refactor to make all the *Resource classes to inherit from a Resource (that will centralize the logging initialization)

NOT TO DO:
  3. convert the SignableResource into a Signer initialized only once, and passed to every Resource needing it.
  Some methods involved are not thread safe.
